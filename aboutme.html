    <h1>About me...</h1>
    <p>Hi!! My name is Maria! I am a student at URI studying music education and clarinet performance. Aside <br>
    from clarinet, I can also play saxophone and baritone horn. I'm also currently learning to play piano! I <br>
    also enjoy conducting and hope to be a band director someday. I took this CSC class because I am intrested <br>
    in coding and learning how to build a website. </p>
    <p>Besides music, some of my other hobbies include drawing and playing videogames. I have been drawing since I<br>
    was five years old and started playing videogames around the age of six. Some of my favorite videogames are <br>
    from the Pok√©mon and Zelda franchises. I also have two English Labs named Dutch and Harriet.</p>
